## Interactive Shopping List
This project is a simple interactive shopping list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the entire list. The application dynamically updates the DOM based on user actions.

### Features
Add Items: Users can enter an item in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
Mark Purchased: Items in the list can be marked as purchased by clicking on them, which visually indicates their status (e.g., with a strikethrough or different background color).
Clear List: Clicking the "Clear List" button removes all items from the list.
## Bonus Features
Edit Items: Users can edit existing items by implementing additional functionality to allow inline editing.
Persistence: Implementing local storage ensures that the shopping list persists even after the page is refreshed or closed.
## Learning Outcomes
Practice with array iteration to access and manipulate list items.
Gain experience in dynamically modifying the DOM based on user interaction.
Reinforce understanding of event listeners and their role in creating interactive applications.
## Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and basic content.
CSS: Styling and layout.
